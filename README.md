# pytorch_1.8.1_low_GPU_version
GT-740M，3.0 plus nvidia GPU should be work, not tested

file are uploaded to baidu pan, because of file size limit of github and pypi

as 2G vga ram is too small for an normal project, just for fun, and learning deep learning toy data, enjoy

just find a pytorch-LMS can use ram for gpu，but not actively developed already, however, if used for study，maybe a good solution to let 'out of memory' go

see below:

# sloution 1
Maybe try to compile it someday!
https://github.com/mtbrandy/pytorch#binaries
# solution2
koila https://github.com/rentruewang/koila
# maybe solution 3
https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairscale/

It seems solution 2 is better, regardless of time using.
